This project uses a neural network to create basic HTML and CSS code based on a design mockup.   
## Overview
1. Provide neural network with image of design 
2. Network creates front-end code based on design   

The repository is based on and inspired by Emil Wallner's [work](https://github.com/emilwallner/Screenshot-to-code/blob/master/README.md).
